# BigBrain Accessibility Improvements

This file outlines the accessibility features implemented in the BigBrain application to ensure it's usable by people with a wide range of abilities.

## Keyboard Navigation

- **Focus Management**: Implemented proper focus management throughout the application:
  - Initial focus automatically set on primary action buttons in modals using `initialFocusRef`
  - Focus trapping within modal dialogs to prevent keyboard users from tabbing out
  - Logical tab order following the visual flow of the interface
  - Properly timed focus with `setTimeout` to ensure reliable behavior after component mounting

- **Actionable Elements**: All interactive elements can be accessed and activated using only the keyboard:
  - Buttons with proper focus states
  - Interactive components with `tabIndex={0}` attribute where appropriate
  - No keyboard traps that prevent users from navigating through the application

## Screen Reader Support

- **Semantic HTML**: Structured content with proper semantic HTML elements for better screen reader compatibility:
  - Used appropriate heading levels (h1-h6) to create a logical document outline
  - Implemented lists for related items with proper list markup
  - Used buttons for interactive elements and anchors for navigation

- **ARIA Attributes**: Added ARIA attributes to improve screen reader information:
  - `aria-describedby` on complex components (like charts) to provide additional context
  - Descriptive text for data visualizations with proper IDs for association
  - Proper labeling of form controls and interactive elements

- **Meaningful Alternative Text**: Provided descriptive alternatives for non-text content:
  - Icon buttons with appropriate aria-labels
  - Images with alt text that describes their purpose and meaning
  - Status indicators with appropriate text alternatives

## Visual Considerations

- **Color Contrast**: Ensured sufficient color contrast ratios between foreground and background elements:
  - Text colors against backgrounds meet WCAG AA standard (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
  - Interactive elements have sufficient contrast against surrounding content
  - Error states use both color and icons to convey meaning

- **Visual Feedback**: Implemented multiple visual cues to not rely solely on color:
  - Success and error states use both color and icons (CheckCircleIcon, CancelIcon)
  - Form validation provides text feedback alongside color indicators
  - Button states include shape/elevation changes in addition to color

- **Responsive Text**: Text sizes scale appropriately across different screen sizes:
  - Used relative units (rem) for font sizes
  - Implemented responsive typography that adjusts based on viewport size
  - Maintained text legibility at all scales

## Interactive Components

- **Accessible Modals**: Modal dialogs follow accessibility best practices:
  - ARIA roles and properties to announce modal state
  - Focus management for keyboard users
  - Clear visual structure with proper headings
  - Descriptive action buttons

- **Data Visualizations**: Charts and graphs include accessibility features:
  - Text descriptions of chart content
  - Color schemes with sufficient contrast
  - `tabIndex={0}` to ensure keyboard focus
  - `aria-describedby` linking to descriptive content

- **Form Controls**: Input fields and controls are accessible:
  - Proper labeling using semantically associated labels
  - Error messages linked programmatically to inputs
  - Clear visual and text feedback for validation

## Responsive Design for Accessibility

- **Flexible Layouts**: Implemented responsive design patterns that adapt to various device capabilities:
  - Layouts that adjust gracefully to text size changes
  - Content that remains accessible when zoomed
  - Touch targets of sufficient size for motor impaired users

- **Mobile Accessibility**: Ensured the application works well on mobile devices:
  - Properly sized touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
  - Clear visual hierarchy on small screens
  - Simplified interactions where appropriate

## Testing and Standards Compliance

- **WCAG Compliance**: Designed with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards:
  - Perceivable: Information is presented in ways all users can perceive
  - Operable: Interface components and navigation are operable
  - Understandable: Information and operation are understandable
  - Robust: Content can be interpreted reliably by assistive technologies

These accessibility improvements make BigBrain more inclusive and usable for all users, including those with disabilities, improving the overall user experience for everyone.
